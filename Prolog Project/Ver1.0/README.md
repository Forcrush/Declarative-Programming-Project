# fillin-crossword-puzzles
A prolog implementation of the filling crossword puzzle. 

A fillin puzzle (sometimes called a fill-it-in) is like a crossword puzzle, except that instead of being given obscure clues telling which words go where, you are given a list of all the words to place in the puzzle, but not told where they go.

A description of the puzzle can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill-In_(puzzle)
